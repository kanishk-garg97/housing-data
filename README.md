# housing-data

# To run the code, download the R code and dataset at same location in order for it to work, else give the correct location of the dataset from your system for the code to work.

Task: Suppose that you work as a data analyst at an estate agency. They are interested in using machine learning to understand the housing market. With the help of myfontR, each group will analyse the dataset house-data.csv” from the point of view of classification, prediction and subsequently validation, as below. You should use R in order to conduct your statistical analysis. You should include the R code as part of an Appendix of your report which should run without errors. When answering the questions you should explain the method used and justify your answers. For each task, you are expected to comment on your findings.

1. Provide numerical and graphical summaries of the data set and make any initial comments that you deem appropriate.

2. Divide houses based on their overall condition (OverallCond) as follows:
• Poor if the overall condition is between 1 to 3.
• Average if the overall condition is between 4 and 6.
• Good if the overall condition is between 7 and 10.
(a) Fit a logistic regression model which predicts the overall condition (OverallCond) of a house. 
(b) Carry out a similar study using a different classification method know to classify the house condition.

3. Predicting house prices:
(a) Employ two methods in order to predict house prices. Justify your choice of model and comment on the results you obtained.
(b) Use two re-sampling methods of your choice to estimate the test error associated with fitting these particular methods chosen in 3(a) on a set of observations. Comment on the results you obtained.

4. Using this data set, house-data.csv, what else would be interesting in investigating? Identify a ‘research question’ in relation to housing data and employ methodology we know to answer this question.
